Write a collection of applications in C that communicate over DBUS.

Application 1:
The application should be a simple queue that holds items that consist 
of a name (512 chars max) and a unit32 value.  The application should 
expose two DBUS interfaces, one to add items to the queue and one to  
pop them off the queue.  The application should display what it is  
doing and run until a key is hit.

Application 2:
The application should communicate with Application 1 over DBUS and  
randomly add items to the queue as long as it is running.  The app  
should display what it is adding to the queue and run until a key is
hit

Application 3:
The application should communicate with Application 1 over DBUS and  
randomly remove items from the queue as long as it is running.  The  
app should display what is is removing from the queue and run until a 
key is hit.
