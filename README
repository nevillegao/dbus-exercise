Introduction
============

This project contains three applications including one receiver and two senders. 
The applications designed using low-level D-Bus C API. So they could communicate 
with each other over DBUS. 

One sender will send a signal every one second to inform the receiver to randomly 
add an item to the queue that holds items (1024 default) that consists of a name 
and a value. The other sender will invoke a remote method every five seconds to 
remove an item from the queue randomly. 

The applications run until 'CTRL-C' is hit. Especially, the receiver will exit 
if the queue is full or empty.

Installation
============

To install this project, you should first unzip the tarball to a directory, and 
enter the directory to type the command "./configure && make && sudo make install". 
The applications will be compiled and installed to your system directory 
("/usr/local/bin" default) which you can change when running the command "./configure" 
using the configure option '--prefix='.

Then you could type commands "receiver", "sender_add" or "sender_remove" to run 
the collection of applications which displays what it is doing.

If there is a warning says 
"Connection Error (Failed to execute dbus-launch to autolaunch D-Bus session)" 
when you want to run applications, do the following to solve it: 
* type command "dbus-launch" 
* export the given paths
